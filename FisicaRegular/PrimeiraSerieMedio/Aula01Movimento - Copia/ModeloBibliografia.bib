	abstract = {China's primary energy consumption increases rapidly, which is highly related to China's sustainable development and has great impact on global energy market. Two univariate models, {ARIMA} (the autoregressive integrated moving average) model and {GM}(1,1) model, are used to forecast China's primary energy consumption. The results of the two models are in line with requirements. Through comparing, it is found that the fitted values of {ARIMA} model respond less to the fluctuations because they are bounded by its long-term trend while those of {GM}(1,1) model respond more due to the usage of the latest four data. And the residues of the two models are opposite in a statistical sense, according to Wilcoxon signed rank test. So a hybrid model is constructed with these two models, and its {MAPE} (Mean Absolute Percent Error) is smaller than {ARIMA} model and {GM}(1,1) model. And then, China's primary energy consumption is forecasted by using the three models. And the results indicate that the growth rate of China's primary energy consumption from 2014 to 2020 will be rather big, but smaller than the first decade of the new century.},

	abstract = {A new Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition ({EEMD}) is presented. This new approach consists of sifting an ensemble of white noise-added signal (data) and treats the mean as the final true result. Finite, not infinitesimal, amplitude white noise is necessary to force the ensemble to exhaust all possible solutions in the sifting process, thus making the different scale signals to collate in the proper intrinsic mode functions ({IMF}) dictated by the dyadic filter banks. As {EEMD} is a time–space analysis method, the added white noise is averaged out with sufficient number of trials; the only persistent part that survives the averaging process is the component of the signal (original data), which is then treated as the true and more physical meaningful answer. The effect of the added white noise is to provide a uniform reference frame in the time–frequency space; therefore, the added noise collates the portion of the signal of comparable scale in one {IMF}. With this ensemble mean, one can separate scales naturally without any a priori subjective criterion selection as in the intermittence test for the original {EMD} algorithm. This new approach utilizes the full advantage of the statistical characteristics of white noise to perturb the signal in its true solution neighborhood, and to cancel itself out after serving its purpose; therefore, it represents a substantial improvement over the original {EMD} and is a truly noise-assisted data analysis ({NADA}) method.},

Therefore, a novel hybrid forecasting framework based on the ensemble empirical mode decomposition ({EEMD}) approach and a combination of individual forecasting models is proposed. The hybrid models include the autoregressive integrated moving average ({ARIMA}), the support vector regression ({SVR}), and the genetic algorithm ({GA}). The integrated framework, the so-called {EEMD}-{ARIMA}-{GA}-{SVR}, will be used to predict the primary energy consumption of an economy. An empirical study case based on the Taiwanese consumption of energy will be used to verify the feasibility of the proposed forecast framework. According to the empirical study results, the proposed hybrid framework is feasible. Compared with prediction results derived from other forecasting mechanisms, the proposed framework demonstrates better precisions, but such a hybrid system can also be seen as a basis for energy management and policy definition.},

	abstract = {Photoplethysmography ({PPG}) has been widely used in noninvasive blood volume and blood flow detection since its first appearance. However, its noninvasiveness also makes the {PPG} signals vulnerable to noise interference and thus exhibits nonlinear and nonstationary characteristics, which have brought difficulties for the denoising of {PPG} signals. Ensemble empirical mode decomposition known as {EEMD}, which has made great progress in noise processing, is a noise-assisted nonlinear and nonstationary time series analysis method based on empirical mode decomposition ({EMD}). The {EEMD} method solves the “mode mixing” problem in {EMD} effectively, but it can do nothing about the “end effect,” another problem in the decomposition process. In response to this problem, an improved {EEMD} method based on support vector regression extension ({SVR}-{EEMD}) is proposed and verified by simulated data and real-world {PPG} data. Experiments show that the {SVR}-{EEMD} method can solve the “end effect” efficiently to get a better decomposition performance than the traditional {EEMD} method and bring more benefits to the noise processing of {PPG} signals.},

	abstract = {A new method for analysing nonlinear and non-stationary data has been developed. The key part of the method is the ‘empirical mode decomposition’ method with which any complicated data set can be decomposed into a finite and often small number of ‘intrinsic mode functions’ that admit well-behaved Hilbert transforms. This decomposition method is adaptive, and, therefore, highly efficient. Since the decomposition is based on the local characteristic time scale of the data, it is applicable to nonlinear and non-stationary processes. With the Hilbert transform, the ‘instrinic mode functions’ yield instantaneous frequencies as functions of time that give sharp identifications of imbedded structures. The final presentation of the results is an energy-frequency-time distribution, designated as the Hilbert spectrum. In this method, the main conceptual innovations are the introduction of ‘intrinsic mode functions’ based on local properties of the signal, which make the instantaneous frequency meaningful; and the introduction of the instantaneous frequencies for complicated data sets, which eliminate the need for spurious harmonics to represent nonlinear and non-stationary signals. Examples from the numerical results of the classical nonlinear equation systems and data representing natural phenomena are given to demonstrate the power of this new method. Classical nonlinear system data are especially interesting, for they serve to illustrate the roles played by the nonlinear and non-stationary effects in the energy-frequency-time distribution.},

Of course, the relative magnitude of the residue noise could be reduced with large enough ensemble, it would be too time consuming to implement. An improved algorithm of noise enhanced data analysis method is suggested in this paper. In this approach, the residue of added white noises can be extracted from the mixtures of data and white noises via pairs of complementary ensemble {IMFs} with positive and negative added white noises.

However, in real crimes data, it is common that the data consists of both linear and nonlinear components. A single model may not be sufficient to identify all the characteristics of the data. The purpose of this study is to introduce a hybrid model that combines support vector regression ({SVR}) and autoregressive integrated moving average ({ARIMA}) to be applied in crime rates forecasting. {SVR} is very robust with small training data and high-dimensional problem. Meanwhile, {ARIMA} has the ability to model several types of time series. However, the accuracy of the {SVR} model depends on values of its parameters, while {ARIMA} is not robust to be applied to small data sets. Therefore, to overcome this problem, particle swarm optimization is used to estimate the parameters of the {SVR} and {ARIMA} models. The proposed hybrid model is used to forecast the property crime rates of the United State based on economic indicators. The experimental results show that the proposed hybrid model is able to produce more accurate forecasting results as compared to the individual models.},

To remain competitive, business firms look for ways of improving their ability to gauge business and economic conditions around the world. At the same time, advances in technology have revolutionized the way we process information and prepare business and economic forecasts. Secondary data searches, data collection, data entry and analysis, graphical visualization, and reporting can all be accomplished with the help of computers that provide access to information not previously available. Forecasters should therefore learn the techniques and models involved, as applied in this new era.

Business Forecasting: A Practical Approach is intended as an applied text for students and practitioners of forecasting who have some background in economics and statistics. The presentation is conceptual in nature with emphasis on rationale, application, and interpretation of the most commonly used forecasting techniques. The goal of this book is to provide students and managers with an overview of a broad range of techniques and an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. It is based on the assumption that forecasting skills are best developed and retained by starting with simple models, followed by repeated exposure to real world examples. The book makes extensive use of international examples to amplify concepts.},

However, the applications of {SVR} models in a seasonal time series forecasting has not been widely investigated. This study aims at developing a seasonal support vector regression ({SSVR}) model to forecast seasonal time series data. Seasonal factors and trends are utilized in the {SSVR} model to perform forecasts. Furthermore, hybrid genetic algorithms and tabu search ({GA}/{TS}) algorithms are applied in order to select three parameters of {SSVR} models. In this study, two other forecasting models, autoregressive integrated moving average ({SARIMA}) and {SVR} are employed for forecasting the same data sets. Empirical results indicate that the {SSVR} outperforms both {SVR} and {SARIMA} models in terms of forecasting accuracy. Thus, the {SSVR} model is an effective method for seasonal time series forecasting.},

Owing to the fact that emergency patient flow is highly uncertain and dynamic, the forecasting problem is regarded as a complicated task. As the emergency patient flow may have both linear and nonlinear patterns, this paper presents a hybrid {ARIMA}-{SVR} approach, which hybridizes autoregressive integrated moving average ({ARIMA}) model and support vector regression ({SVR}) model to predict emergency patient arrivals. The proposed model is applied to 4 years of daily emergency visits data in the radiology department of a large hospital to justify the performance of the hybrid model against single models. The {MAPE}, {RMSE} and {MAE} of the hybrid model are 7.02\%, 19.20 and 14.97, respectively. Furthermore, the hybrid model achieves better prediction performance than its competitors because it can capture the linear and nonlinear patterns simultaneously. Experimental results indicate that the proposed hybrid {ARIMA}-{SVR} approach is a promising alternative for forecasting emergency patient flow. These findings are beneficial for efficient patient flow management and scheduling decisions optimization.},

	abstract = {This book sets out to explain what genetic algorithms are and how they can be used to solve real-world problems. The first objective is tackled by the editor, Lawrence Davis. The remainder of the book is turned over to a series of short review articles by a collection of authors, each explaining how genetic algorithms have been applied to problems in their own specific area of interest. The first part of the book introduces the fundamental genetic algorithm ({GA}), explains how it has traditionally been designed and implemented and shows how the basic technique may be applied to a very simple numerical optimisation problem. The basic technique is then altered and refined in a number of ways, with the effects of each change being measured by comparison against the performance of the original. In this way, the reader is provided with an uncluttered introduction to the technique and learns to appreciate why certain variants of {GA} have become more popular than others in the scientific community. Davis stresses that the choice of a suitable representation for the problem in hand is a key step in applying the {GA}, as is the selection of suitable techniques for generating new solutions from old. He is refreshingly open in admitting that much of the business of adapting the {GA} to specific problems owes more to art than to science. It is nice to see the terminology associated with this subject explained, with the author stressing that much of the field is still an active area of research. Few assumptions are made about the reader's mathematical background. The second part of the book contains thirteen cameo descriptions of how genetic algorithmic techniques have been, or are being, applied to a diverse range of problems. Thus, one group of authors explains how the technique has been used for modelling arms races between neighbouring countries (a non- linear, dynamical system), while another group describes its use in deciding design trade-offs for military aircraft. My own favourite is a rather charming account of how the {GA} was applied to a series of scheduling problems. Having attempted something of this sort with Simulated Annealing, I found it refreshing to see the authors highlighting some of the problems that they had encountered, rather than sweeping them under the carpet as is so often done in the scientific literature. The editor points out that there are standard {GA} tools available for either play or serious development work. Two of these ({GENESIS} and {OOGA}) are described in a short, third part of the book. As is so often the case nowadays, it is possible to obtain a diskette containing both systems by sending your Visa card details (or \$60) to an address in the {USA}.},

It focuses in depth on a small set of important and interesting topics—particularly in machine learning, scientific modeling, and artificial life—and reviews a broad span of research, including the work of Mitchell and her colleagues.The descriptions of applications and modeling projects stretch beyond the strict boundaries of computer science to include dynamical systems theory, game theory, molecular biology, ecology, evolutionary biology, and population genetics, underscoring the exciting "general purpose" nature of genetic algorithms as search methods that can be employed across disciplines.An Introduction to Genetic Algorithms is accessible to students and researchers in any scientific discipline. It includes many thought and computer exercises that build on and reinforce the reader's understanding of the text. The first chapter introduces genetic algorithms and their terminology and describes two provocative applications in detail. The second and third chapters look at the use of genetic algorithms in machine learning (computer programs, data analysis and prediction, neural networks) and in scientific models (interactions among learning, evolution, and culture; sexual selection; ecosystems; evolutionary activity). Several approaches to the theory of genetic algorithms are discussed in depth in the fourth chapter. The fifth chapter takes up implementation, and the last chapter poses some currently unanswered questions and surveys prospects for the future of evolutionary computation.},

Nonetheless, designing {ML} models remains a challenge and requires further research as most procedures adopt a trial and error strategy. In this study, we present a methodology to optimize the architecture and the feature configurations of {ML} models considering a supervised learning process. The proposed approach employs genetic algorithm ({GA})-based integer-valued optimization for two {ML} models, namely deep neural networks ({DNN}) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system ({ANFIS}). The selected variables in the {DNN} optimization problems are the number of hidden layers, their number of neurons and their activation function, while the type and the number of membership functions are the design variables in the {ANFIS} optimization problem. The mean squared error ({MSE}) between the predictions and the target outputs is minimized as the optimization fitness function. The proposed scheme is validated through a case study of computational material design. We apply the method to predict the fracture energy of polymer/nanoparticles composites ({PNCs}) with a database gathered from the literature. The optimized {DNN} model shows superior prediction accuracy compared to the classical one-hidden layer network. Also, it outperforms {ANFIS} with significantly lower number of generations in {GA}. The proposed method can be easily extended to optimize similar architecture properties of {ML} models in various complex systems.},

	abstract = {Regression testing is the essential process of software maintenance and evolution phase of the software development life cycle for assuring the quality and reliability of updated software. Test case prioritization is the technique of regression testing to reduce the time and effort required for regression testing. Search-based algorithms are used to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the method. Among these search-based optimization algorithms, genetic algorithms are becoming more popular among researchers since the last decade. In this paper, we are doing a systematic literature review, i.e., a secondary study of test case prioritization using genetic algorithms. The objective of this review is to examine and classify the current state of use of the genetic algorithm in test case prioritization. In other words, to give a base for the advancement of test case prioritization research using genetic algorithms. With the use of the systematic literature review protocol, we selected the most relevant studies (20 out of 384) from the appropriate repositories by using a set of search keywords, inclusion/exclusion criteria and the quality assessment of studies. The data extraction and synthesis process and the taxonomic classification are used to answer the research questions. We also performed a rigorous analysis of the techniques by comparing them on research methodology, the prioritization method, dataset specification, test suite size, types of genetic algorithms used, performance metrics, and the validation criteria. The whole process took four months for comprehensive analysis and classification of primary studies. We observed that the parameter settings, the type of operators, the probabilistic rate of operators, and fitness function design have a significant impact on the quality of the solutions obtained. This systematic literature review yields that genetic algorithms have great potential in solving test case prioritization problems, and the area is open for further improvements. Future researchers can fill the research gaps by following the suggestions given in the review. From this review, we found that the use of the appropriate approach can make a genetic algorithm based test case prioritization one of the effective methods in regression testing.},

Many scholars have found that the output performance of hybrid system is an important reason to determine the life of fuel cell. Unreasonable output will affect the control characteristics of the drive system, resulting in a series of serious consequences such as the reduction of the life of fuel cell hybrid power system. Therefore, the energy management strategy and performance optimization of hybrid system is the key to ensure the normal operation of the system. At present, many excellent researchers have carried out relevant research in this field. Genetic algorithm is a heuristic algorithm, which has better optimization performance. It can easily choose satisfactory solutions according to the optimization objectives, and make up for these shortcomings by using its own characteristics. These characteristics make genetic algorithm have outstanding advantages in the iterative optimization of energy management strategy. This paper analyzes and summarizes the optimization effect of genetic algorithm in various energy management strategies, aiming to analyze and select the optimization rules and parameters, optimization objects and optimization objectives. This paper hopes to provide guidance for the optimal control strategy and structural design of the fuel cell hybrid power system, contribute to the research on improving the energy utilization efficiency of the hybrid power system and extending the life of the fuel cell, and provide more ideas for the optimization of energy management in the future.},

This line of research is highly contingent upon reliable stock ranking for successful portfolio construction. Recent advances in machine learning and data mining are leading to significant opportunities to solve these problems more effectively. In this study, we aim at developing a methodology for effective stock selection using support vector regression ({SVR}) as well as genetic algorithms ({GAs}). We first employ the {SVR} method to generate surrogates for actual stock returns that in turn serve to provide reliable rankings of stocks. Top-ranked stocks can thus be selected to form a portfolio. On top of this model, the {GA} is employed for the optimization of model parameters, and feature selection to acquire optimal subsets of input variables to the {SVR} model. We will show that the investment returns provided by our proposed methodology significantly outperform the benchmark. Based upon these promising results, we expect this hybrid {GA}–{SVR} methodology to advance the research in soft computing for finance and provide an effective solution to stock selection in practice.},

	abstract = {Both primary energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions in the world increased continuously showing the same trends because nearly 90\% of primary energy consumption was fossil fuel combustion. Only the economic depression of the world led to suppression of increases in primary energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. Primary energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions of developed countries kept high levels and those of developing countries increased with higher rates after 2000. Primary energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions of developing countries exceeded those of {OECD} countries in 2010, but their populations were 78.0 and 18.1\% of world population in 2015, respectively. If all people in the whole world are allowed the world average primary energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions per person in the world, developing country people are allowed almost 1.5 times as high as energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions per person in 2015, while {OECD} country people must decrease 60\% of the values in 2015. Furthermore, the world population is increasing at a constant rate of 83.1 million every year. Because the increase in the primary energy consumption is necessary for industrial and economic development, only the solution for prevention of further increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration is to use renewable energy without fossil fuel combustion.},

	abstract = {The global energy consumption is continuously growing, because the population of Earth and the standard of living expands day by day. As a result, the emission of greenhouse gases increases further more. The various countries use the different types of fuels in varying amount.In this study we have examined the primary energy consumption of the countries, according to the {BP} Statistical Review of World Energy June 2016 ({BP}, 2016), based upon their usage of fuels.The assay resulted in a 7 cluster model. With one exception, each cluster contains a resource, which is used in a much larger amount than in the other clusters. As a result, we may differentiate between an average cluster, and the clusters of countries that use primarily hydropower, nuclear energy, renewable energy, coal, fossil oil, and natural gas.We have examined if there is any connection between the location of a country in a cluster and its {HDI}, as well as the countries’ competitiveness.},
